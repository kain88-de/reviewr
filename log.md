## Multi-Platform Integration Plan

### JIRA Integration (Future Phase)
**Goal**: Track employee involvement in ticket/project management

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **JIRA API Client** (`src/core/jira.rs`)
   - Create JiraConfig struct (url, username, api_token)
   - Implement JiraClient with REST API authentication
   - Add JiraService similar to GerritService structure

2. **JIRA Activity Metrics**:
   - **Tickets Created**: Issues created by user
   - **Tickets Resolved**: Issues resolved/closed by user
   - **Tickets Assigned**: Currently assigned issues
   - **Comments Added**: Comments/updates on issues
   - **Sprint Participation**: Issues completed in sprints

3. **Data Structures**:
   ```rust
   #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub struct IssueInfo {
       pub key: String,
       pub summary: String,
       pub status: String,
       pub assignee: String,
       pub created: String,
       pub resolved: Option<String>,
       pub project: String,
   }

   pub struct JiraActivityMetrics {
       pub tickets_created: Vec<IssueInfo>,
       pub tickets_resolved: Vec<IssueInfo>,
       pub tickets_assigned: Vec<IssueInfo>,
       pub comments_added: u32,
   }
   ```

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/rest/api/3/search` - JQL queries for ticket data
   - `/rest/api/3/issue/{issueId}` - Detailed issue information
   - `/rest/api/3/user/search` - User information

5. **TUI Integration**:
   - Add JIRA tabs to ReviewBrowser
   - Show ticket lists with status coloring
   - Link to JIRA ticket URLs for detailed viewing
   - Filter by project, status, date ranges

### GitLab Integration (Future Phase)
**Goal**: Track merge request and repository activity

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **GitLab API Client** (`src/core/gitlab.rs`)
   - Create GitLabConfig struct (url, access_token, username)
   - Implement GitLabClient with token-based authentication
   - Add GitLabService following established patterns

2. **GitLab Activity Metrics**:
   - **Merge Requests Created**: MRs authored by user
   - **Merge Requests Merged**: Successfully merged MRs
   - **Merge Requests Reviewed**: MRs where user provided reviews
   - **Issues Created**: Issues opened by user
   - **Commits Pushed**: Direct commits to repositories

3. **Data Structures**:
   ```rust
   #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub struct MergeRequestInfo {
       pub iid: u32,
       pub title: String,
       pub state: String,
       pub created_at: String,
       pub merged_at: Option<String>,
       pub source_branch: String,
       pub target_branch: String,
       pub project_id: u32,
   }

   pub struct GitLabActivityMetrics {
       pub merge_requests_created: Vec<MergeRequestInfo>,
       pub merge_requests_merged: Vec<MergeRequestInfo>,
       pub merge_requests_reviewed: Vec<MergeRequestInfo>,
       pub issues_created: Vec<IssueInfo>,
       pub commits_pushed: u32,
   }
   ```

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/v4/merge_requests` - MR data with author/reviewer filters
   - `/api/v4/projects/{id}/merge_requests` - Project-specific MRs
   - `/api/v4/issues` - Issues with author filter
   - `/api/v4/users/{id}/projects` - User's project involvement

5. **TUI Integration**:
   - Add GitLab tabs to ReviewBrowser
   - Show MR lists with state indicators (Open/Merged/Closed)
   - Link to GitLab MR/issue URLs
   - Group by project/repository

### Unified Review Dashboard
**Goal**: Single view across all platforms (Gerrit + JIRA + GitLab)

**Architecture**:
1. **Platform Abstraction**:
   ```rust
   pub trait ReviewPlatform {
       async fn get_activity_metrics(&self, user: &str, days: u32) -> Result<PlatformMetrics>;
       fn get_platform_name(&self) -> &str;
       fn is_configured(&self) -> bool;
   }
   ```

2. **Unified Metrics**:
   ```rust
   pub struct UnifiedActivityMetrics {
       pub gerrit: Option<DetailedActivityMetrics>,
       pub jira: Option<JiraActivityMetrics>,
       pub gitlab: Option<GitLabActivityMetrics>,
   }
   ```

3. **Multi-Platform TUI**:
   - Tab-based interface for each platform
   - Summary view combining all platforms
   - Cross-platform search and filtering
   - Export unified reports to CSV/JSON

### Configuration Management
**Updates to config.toml**:
```toml
[gerrit]
gerrit_url = "https://review.example.com"
username = "user"
http_password = "token"

[jira]
jira_url = "https://company.atlassian.net"
username = "user@company.com"
api_token = "token"

[gitlab]
gitlab_url = "https://gitlab.example.com"
access_token = "token"
username = "user"
```

## Future Enhancements (Planned)
- Quality metrics: Average comments per change, review turnaround time, success rate
- Collaboration metrics: Response rates, cross-team reviews, mentoring activity
- Trend analysis and historical comparisons
- JSON/CSV export options
- Multi-platform dashboard integration
- Performance analytics and productivity insights

## Technical Notes
- Using async/await for Gerrit API calls
- 30-second timeout for HTTP requests
- Base64 encoding for HTTP Basic Auth
